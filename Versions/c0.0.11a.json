          "c0.0.11a is a version of Java Edition Classic released on May 17, 2009 at 11:56 UTC, almost 4 minutes after the release of 0.0.10a, to fix the game being unplayable. <br> <br> While there is a version called 'c0.0.11a' in the launcher, it is actually an early development version of 0.0.12a, this future version is seen to be the next version, due to it containing files from May 18, 2009. <br> <br> This is also known as the first public version of Minecraft! This was posted to the TIGSource Forum and was labeled: Minecraft (alpha).",
